# Secure-Cloud-Quantum-Cryptography
  In order to build secure cloud environment, data security and cryptography must be assured to share data through distributed environment. So, this project provides more flexibility and secured communication environment by deploying a new cryptographic service. This service entails both Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and enhanced version of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Moreover, this service solves the key distribution and key management problems in cloud environment.   This project presents a new cryptographic service layer in the cloud environment, Quantum Cryptography as a Service (QCaaS), this service provides the secret key provisioning to  clients, separating both clientsâ€™ cryptographic primitive and credential accounts based on secure cloud domain.   QCaaS reveals many roles such as (i) serving the client security communication and protect their sensitive data, (ii) verification and monitoring the identity of original user, (iii) deploying an encryption service embeds with each rents by the consumers, and (v) achieves the encryption/decryption processes using QAES.
